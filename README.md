# CYRINAE Portfolio Manager Scripts

CYRINAE = Cyber Risk Integrated Automation Engine

![CYRINAE](docs/Security_Data_to_Intelligence_Ecosystem.png)

## What this is For

This repo is for Python, Pandas and other libraries to do higher level processing of cyber compliance, hygiene, and security data.

This is used for testing python and pandas processing on larger CSV type datasets exported from [OpenRMF Professional](https://www.soteriasoft.com/products/openrmf-professional.html) by [Soteria Software](https://www.soteriasoft.com).

We leverage the APIs in the <a href="https://github.com/SoteriaSoftwareLLC/openrmfpro-automation">Automation Repo</a> and combine them here to do higher level features and calculations using your OpenRMF<sup>&reg;</sup> Professional data.

CYRINAE is the all encompassing solution of the following items:
- OpenRMF Professional
- Elastic AI Service Provider Interface (SPI)
- Elastic SIEM SPI
- Slack SPI
- Email SPI
- Portfolio Manager (currently under development)

## How this is Used

This repo has <a href="./scripts">scripts</a> to call APIs with examples as well.  It is organized by topic and area of cyber compliance, hygiene, and security.  It also has example .csv files exported from data in OpenRMF Professional. And it has higher level python scripts to call the OpenRMF Professional external API and process information. 

The <a href="./scripts">scripts</a> is the best place to start to see the main ideas around risk profiling, POAM prioritization, overview PDFs and more. 

## Available Scripts
The scripts available are below. And we have other ones copied from our GH public automation repo at https://github.com/SoteriaSoftwareLLC/openrmfpro-automation/ to show how you use them to do higher level work. 

Most of the scripts below you pass in the root URL, your OpenRMF<sup>&reg;</sup> Professional application key, the token, and then your systemKey. See comments in the scripts if more is required.
